## Intro

Next week I'll be traveling to the [State of the Map Europe](https://stateofthemap.eu) that will be held in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland. My plan is to ride my bike from Berlin.

## Set up

{{< admonition type=tip title="What is best bike?" >}}

> The best bike is the one you have, go out and ride it!

- The Budha

{{< /admonition >}}

I strongly believe that you can enjoy a bike tour on pretty much any bike.

Saying that, this ride will involve a couple big days on the bike. I have learnt a bit about longer riding, and want to ensure a comfy fit over the whole journey. I also want to be as efficient as possible, so I can enjoy the journey and not be too tired when I arrive. The route is mostly flat and I plan to mostly be on the road to save time.

The riding plan is to take it easy and build some endurance from long hours on the bike without pushing it and burning myself out, in a way to prepare for some bigger events coming up.

My priorities are therefore::

- Comfort
- Aero
- Rolling resistance

## Comfort

Trustini is my go to long distance stead. I have done a many long rides on it and know it fits me well. She is a  gravel bike with a buttery smooth frame and a lot of history.

I will attach some aero bars, to give me more hand positions to change between and hopefully avoid any nerve damage[^nerve-damage-in-bikepacking].

## Aero

Considering I am much bigger then the bike, the biggest source of drag is me. I will try to stay as aero as possible. I will wear a tight fitting jersey and bib shorts. They don't look cool but they are practicool.

I also want to avoid wearing a backpack, thankfully a fellow SOTM attendee has offered to take my laptop with him in the bus.

The rest of my stuff I will put in a frame bag and so called "Arse rocket" saddle bag. This way I can stay streamlined and avoid any turbulence extra things. Infact the bags might even help me stay aero according to some sources [bikepacking.com](https://www.apidura.com/journal/apidura-aero-pack-system-packs-that-make-you-faster/).

## Rolling resistance

The least rolling resistance (aka fastest) tire is typically a slick and narrow tire inflated to a high pressure.

This is changing became of new perspectives trying lower pressures and the industry producing tubeless tires and wider rims Fatter and softer tires also means more comfort, which is important for long rides.

I will go for a 32mm tire. I like Continental GP5000 tires, and according to the [rolling resistance data](https://www.bicyclerollingresistance.com/specials/grand-prix-5000-s-tr-comparison) the 32mm version is not much worse then the 25mm version and one of the faster tyres out there.

I will also try a tubeless setup out. This also is reported to have lower rolling resistance according to the same site [bicyclerollingresistance.com](https://www.bicyclerollingresistance.com/specials/grand-prix-5000-s-tr-tubeless-vs-tubes). But lets see how it goes with the tubeless setup. One thing I appreciate about tubes is that they are so easy to fix on the road.

## The Side Quest

So I am going to a mapping convention and want to make the journey part of the adventure and combine two of my passions along the way. Cycling and open data.

On idea I had was that I could add tag information to OpenStreetMap

I am aware of a nice Android app called [Steet Complete]() that assigns you quests to do in a radius near you.

TODO: add a video of street complete.


Think of Pokemon Go but instead of going out and catching a virtual Pikachu, you measure a tree or something weird. I say this is weird because I don't really have any use for the data of how fat a random tree is in Poland, but thats the beauty of Open data. Someone else might find it useful, one mans trash is another mans treasure. And more so, the power comes from the size of the community contributing data. This data point combined with the millions of other enities on OSM that allow a virtual planet to be modelled. Thats powerful stuff.

## The Perfect Wand for the Wizard

> The wand chooses the wizard
- Garrick Ollivander

I was thinking of the perfect app for my ride, I would like a app that knows when I am on a road which has incomplete data about the surface type (or riding past another quest that is drive-by possible). The app should alert me when I am riding up to a new tagging opertunities and show clearly the location of the quest object in question so I can find it. It should then presents me with a clear question and easy to press options on a screen such that I can pull a hit-and-run.

The perfect phone would be something like a unihertz atom, a small rugged phone that can be mounted on the stem and has a long battery life. It would be cool to 3d print a custom mount for it.

## Improving on Street Complete for the Shred community 

## Designing the route

For the route, I would like to maximise the number of "virgin" roads that I tag to maximize my contributions/km. But honest this is already a big enough project and that can be a idea for next time.

I will probably just use komoot to plan it in a couple minuets pre kick off.

## The Wind

Lets see if I get lucky and have a tailwind pushing me all the way to Lodz or a fat head wind.



Mehh its out of my control anyway. will ride either way.

## The goal

Some quick pencil maths says I will probably be moving for 500km / 25km/h = 20 hours.

If I do a quest on a average of every 10 mins, that will be 120 quests. I think that is more then possible.

More then anything I want to have a good time and arrive safely to SOTM.

[^500km]: 500km exactly according to [https://www.komoot.com/tour/1700459745](https://www.komoot.com/tour/1700459745)
