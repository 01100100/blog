## Intro

I found myself at the [State of the Map Europe](https://stateofthemap.eu) event! An annual gathering of OpenStreetMap enthusiasts. I am relatively new to the OSM world and saw it as a fantastic chance to get involved and learn more about the community and the projects happening in the space. Oh my, what a big space it turns out to be! OSM is everywhere.

Some special talks, for no specific reasons:

* [AI-assisted mapping by the Humanitarian OSM Team (HOT🔥)](https://cfp.openstreetmap.org.pl/state-of-the-map-europe-2024/talk/PQ8VKC/)
* [Flowing Connections: Mapping rivers & streams with WaterwayMap.org](https://cfp.openstreetmap.org.pl/state-of-the-map-europe-2024/talk/K8LF7U/)
* [Supporting Mobility Transitions: OpenStreetMap's Contribution to Public Administration Data Needs](https://cfp.openstreetmap.org.pl/state-of-the-map-europe-2024/talk/V8ZB3U/)
* [Minutely vector tiles for the community](https://cfp.openstreetmap.org.pl/state-of-the-map-europe-2024/talk/M8HTSJ/)

It was great event! Kudos to the organizing team! I met a ton of cool people, soaked up some serious knowledge, and all while enjoying the vibrant city of Łódź.

A lot of folks I met were curious about my journey and had many questions about how I managed to transport myself to the event.

This blog post spills the beans on how I prepared to ride my bike from Berlin to SOTM, held in Łódź, Poland. 500km[^500km] in 2 days.

## Setup

{{< admonition type=tip title="What is the best bike?" open=false >}}

The best bike is the one you have --- just get out and ride it!

--- The Buddha (Probably)

{{< /admonition >}}

I'm a firm believer that you can enjoy a bike tour on pretty much any bike with the right mindset.

I wanted to go fast and efficiently, stay comfy, and not be totally done by the time I arrived. The route was mostly flat, so weight wasn't an issue, and I would mostly ride on the road to save time. I would split the ride over 2 days and decided to stay overnight in a hotel in Poznan. This meant I would avoid taking my tent, sleeping setup, and cooking gear, and only take with me things that were essential for the conference.

Here’s how I optimized my setup for the journey:

My priorities:

* Comfort
* Aero
* Rolling resistance

### Comfort

Meet Trustini, my go-to long-distance steed.

![Trustini](/images/trustini.jpg)

I have done many long rides on this bike and know it fits me well. A gravel bike with a relaxed geometry, built around a buttery smooth titanium frame, and a lot of history. We have a good relationship built on years of trust and going places together.

{{< admonition type=info title="Bike fit" open=false >}}

Bike fitting is essentially moving the different parts of the bike around to fit the rider. You want to be in a position when cycling that optimizes comfort, performance, and efficiency.

There are many resources online to help you get a good fit:

* The classic "Bicycling and Pain" article by [Sheldon Brown](https://www.sheldonbrown.com/pain.html).
* [Physio-Pedia on Bike Fit](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Bike_Fit)

There are also professional bike fitting services.

{{< /admonition >}}

For comfort over long distances, the contact points are where the magic happens: saddle, handlebars, and pedals. These are where your discomfort can accumulate, which, if undealt with, can lead to trouble. Everyone's body is different, and it is best to experiment with different setups and find out what works for you personally.

I use a narrow [Brooks C13 Cambium](https://www.brooksengland.com/en_eu/c13.html) saddle with a bit of flex and team it up with my most comfortable bib shorts from Santini that include a butt-saving "C3 seat pad with anti-shock gel inserts". This combination has proven itself on many long rides.

![Santini C3 seat pad](/images/santini-pad.png)

For the handlebars, I use the thickest bar tape I can find. More cushion absorbs the vibrations that come through the bars better. I also wear padded gloves.

![Different width bar tapes are available.](/images/bartape.png)

My friend Michael gave me some aero bars to try out. This gives me more hand positions to switch between, helping avoid any nerve damage[^nerve-damage-in-bikepacking] from the long days in the saddle.

![Ironman tri bars](/images/ironman.png)

I use clip-in pedals with stiff shoes that fit me well. This means I can pedal more efficiently and have the force evenly distributed around my whole foot.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->
**The combination of these things hopefully means I can ride for hours without any discomfort 🤞**

### Aerodynamics

When cycling above 15km/h, the biggest thing slowing you down is air resistance or drag.

Considering I am much bigger than the bike, the biggest source of drag is me. Changing your position on the bike can make a big difference.

![Aerodynamic study of different riding positions](/images/aero-positions.png)

While I will try to stay as aero as possible, a comfortable position is more important, and I don't want to change too much.

I wore a tight-fitting jersey. Not because it looks cool, but because it's practicool and faster to have skin-fitting clothes on than things flapping around.

Wearing a helmet actually reduces drag and makes you faster, as proven by Greg LeMond in the 1989 Tour de France[^aero-helmet]. People actually compare helmets to see which one is fastest[^helmet-test].

I wear an Oakley Ar05 Race helmet which does a good job. I also use sun glasses with a big lens to protect my eyes from the sun, wind, and bugs. The frame of the glasses matches up with the helmet and reduces drag even further. Marginal gains, but hey, I will take every saving I can!

The rest of my stuff was stashed in my bike bags. Top tube bag + frame bag + so-called "Arse Rocket" saddle bag. The bags are positioned to avoid increasing the frontal area and avoid any extra turbulence. In fact, the bags might even help me stay aero according to some sources[^aero-bike-bags].

![My bike](/images/aero-trustini.png)

It was my first time using aero bars, and it was a game changer. My intention was to give me some different positions to rest my hands. But oh boy, when I was in the aero bar position, I realized they also make you significantly more streamlined and faster, piercing through the air. It was also super comfortable to be able to switch between the different positions. I will definitely be using them again on long rides.

Plus, I could mount my phone on the aero bars in a chiller position, optimal for navigation and changing up tunes on the go.

![Phone + aero bar setup](/images/phone-mount.png)

### Rolling Resistance

There is another contact point: the tires. The tires are the only thing touching the ground and are the biggest source of rolling resistance.

Traditionally, the fastest (aka the least rolling resistance) tire is slick and narrow, inflated to high pressure.

This idea is changing because of new perspectives, lower pressures, and the industry producing tubeless tires and wider rims. According to new trends, a wider tire at a lower pressure can be faster than a narrow tire at a high pressure, especially on rougher surfaces.

I like Continental GP5000 tires, and according to the rolling resistance data[^rolling-resistance], the 32mm version, which I am using, is not much worse than the skinny 25mm version, and is one of the faster tires available.

![Grand Prix 5000 Different Width Rolling Resistance Test](/images/width_rolling_resistance.png)

Using 32mm, fatter and softer tires also means more comfort, especially on the rough stuff, which is important for long rides.

**With all this setup, I should be rolling with ease. The only thing left to do was to pack my bags and hit the road 🚴**

## The Route

I used [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com) to plan the route. I put in my start and end locations and set Poznan as a waypoint to break up the journey. I tweaked the route by adding a waypoint in a national park to avoid the main road, and that was it.

![Komoot route planner](/images/komoot-route-planner.png)

Komoot returns the surface type and elevation expected along the route to give you a good idea of what to expect and allow you to pace yourself.

Komoot Premium has a feature that shows the expected weather along the route at the time you are expected to be there. It also shows the sunrise and sunset times. Super useful for deciding what to take out with you on a tour.

I saved  offline on my phone, strapped it to my handlebars, and navigated my way.

## The Wind

Nature plays a huge factor in cycling, but it's beyond your control. Sometimes you get unlucky and have a rainy headwind all day; sometimes you get blown off your bike by a gust of wind, but that is all part of the fun.

I used [windy.com](https://www.windy.com) to check the wind forecast, and it looked like the wind gods would be blowing in my favor for once!

![Windy forecast](/videos/windy.gif)

Get in! I would have a tailwind all the way to Łódź.

It was also to be dry and hot, which means a lower air density and even less drag. I got lucky.

![Temperature Forecast](/images/heat.png)

## The Journey

TODO: talk about dropping a laptop off at Dominik's and then leaving Berlin, the first 100km to the border, the border crossing, the first night in Poland, the second day, and the arrival in Łódź.

I avoided wearing a backpack. Thankfully, a fellow SOTM attendee offered to take my laptop with him on the bus.

TODO: talk about going over the Oder River and noticing the difference in surface quality.

TODO: talk about the lake.

TODO: talk about how clean Poland is and how there was no trash anywhere.

![A beautiful polish road](/images/polish-road.jpg)

TODO: talk about something happening in Poznan.

TODO: talk about the sun and tan lines.

TODO: Talk about the Polish gravel gang you met after not seeing anyone on a bike for 400km and how they raced into town and got some burgers.

![The Polish Gravel Gang](/images/unicorn.jpeg)

## The Food

A few people asked me how I would eat on the road.

A key to long distance cycling is fueling the body with enough calories to sustain the effort your putting out. If you don't you might find yourself in a unlucky situation called "bonking".

I like to take things like Bananas, Musil bars, Crossiants and have a adocate stash in my top tube bag. I will eat these regularly while riding to keep my energy levels up.

In Poland, you find "Sklep Polski" everywhere, which are small local shops selling everything you need and can resupply. The owners were always nice and refilled my water bottles. I also wanted to taste some traditional Polish food, so I stopped at a couple of restaurants along the way and had some great pierogi.

![Yet another Sklep Polski](/images/sklep.jpg)

Since it was so hot, I needed to drink a lot of water on the ride, like 6 litres a day. However it was never a problem to find clean water on route. I took some isotonic tablets with me to stay hydrated.

## Key Takeaways for Long-Distance Cycling in 2024

* Bike Fit: Ensure your bike fits you well. Small adjustments can make a huge difference in comfort and performance.
* Hydration and Nutrition: Plan your food and water intake meticulously. Staying hydrated and fueled is crucial for maintaining energy levels.
* Gear: Invest in quality gear that prioritizes comfort and efficiency. Aero bars, padded shorts, and proper tires can significantly enhance your ride.
* Route Planning: Use tools like Komoot to plan your route in detail. Knowing the terrain and expected weather conditions helps in better preparation.

## Conclusion

State of the Map 2024 was fantastic! I had a great time and learned a lot, which could fill another blog post.

The journey itself was a highlight and went incredibly well.

Traveling across Poland by bike gave me an opportunity to see the country evolve. I saw the small villages, the fields, the forests, the rivers, and the big cities. I had a lot of time to see it and take it all in.

Cycling has many uncountable benefits, but for me, it's the best way to travel and straight-up fun. I recommend for anyone interested to get out there and give it a go!
