## Intro

So, I found myself at the [State of the Map Europe](https://stateofthemap.eu) event! A annual gathering of OpenSteetMap enthusiasts. I am newish to the OSM world and saw it as a great chance to get involved and learn more about the community and the projects that are happening in the space. Oh my, What a big space it turns out to be! OSM is everywhere.

Some special talks, for no specific reasons:

* [AI-assisted mapping by the Humanitarian OSM Team (HOT🔥)](https://cfp.openstreetmap.org.pl/state-of-the-map-europe-2024/talk/PQ8VKC/)
* [Flowing Connections: Mapping rivers & streams with WaterwayMap.org](https://cfp.openstreetmap.org.pl/state-of-the-map-europe-2024/talk/K8LF7U/)
* [Supporting Mobility Transitions: OpenStreetMap's Contribution to Public Administration Data Need](https://cfp.openstreetmap.org.pl/state-of-the-map-europe-2024/talk/V8ZB3U/)
* [Minutely vector tiles for the community](https://cfp.openstreetmap.org.pl/state-of-the-map-europe-2024/talk/M8HTSJ/)

It was great! Kudos to the organizing team! I met a ton of cool people, soaked up some serious knowledge, and all while enjoying the vibrant city of Łódź.

A lot of folks I met were curios about my journey and had many questions about how I managed to transport myself to the event.

This blog post spills the beans on how I prepared to ride my bike from Berlin to SOTM held in Łódź, Poland. 500km[^500km] in 2 days.

## Set up

{{< admonition type=tip title="What is best bike?" open=false >}}

The best bike is the one you have --- just get out and ride it!

--- The Buddha (Probably)

{{< /admonition >}}

Im a firm believer that you can enjoy a bike tour on pretty much any bike with the right mindset.

For this ride that would involve a couple big days on the bike. I wanted to go fast and efficient, stay comfy, and not be totally done by the time I arrived. The route was mostly flat, so weight wasn't a issue and I would mostly ride on the road to save time.

Here’s how I optimized my setup for the journey.

My priorities:

* Comfort
* Aero
* Rolling resistance

### Comfort

Meet Trustini my go to long distance stead.

![Trustini](/images/trustini.jpg)

I have done many long rides on it and know it fits me well. She is a gravel bike with a relaxed geometry, buttery smooth titanium frame and a lot of history. We have a good relationship built on years of trust and going places together.

{{< admonition type=info title="Bike fit" open=false >}}

Bike fitting is esstentially moving the different parts of the bike around to fit the rider. You want to be in a position when cycling that optimizes comfort, performance and efficiency.

There are many resources online to help you get a good fit.

* The classic "Bicycling and Pain" article by [Sheldon Brown](https://www.sheldonbrown.com/pain.html).
* [https://www.physio-pedia.com/Bike_Fit](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Bike_Fit)

There are also professional bike fitting services.

{{< /admonition >}}

For comfort over long distance, the contact points are where the magic happens: saddle, handlebars and pedals. These are where you discomfort can accumulate, which undealt with, can lead to trouble. Everyone's body is different and it is best to experiment with different setups and find out what works for you personally.

I use a narrow [Brooks C13 Cambium](https://www.brooksengland.com/en_eu/c13.html) saddle with a bit of flex and team it up with a my most comfortable bib shorts from Santini that include a butt saving "C3 seatpad with anti-shock gel inserts". This combination has proven itself on many long rides.

![Santini C3 seatpad](/images/santini-pad.png)

For the handlebars, I use the thickest bar tape I can find. More cushion absorb the vibrations that come through the bars better. I also wear padded gloves.

![Different width bar tapes are available.](/images/bartape.png)

My friend Micheal gave me some aero bars to try out, this gives me more hand positions to switch between, helping avoid any nerve damage[^nerve-damage-in-bikepacking] from the long days in the saddle.

![Ironman tri bars](/images/ironman.png)
I use clip in pedals with a stiff shoe that fits me well. This means I can pedal more efficiently and have the force evenly distributed around my whole foot.

**The combination of these things hopefully means I can ride for hours without any discomfort 🤞**

### Aerodynamics

When cycling above 15km/h, the biggest thing slowing you down is the air resistance or drag.

Considering I am much bigger then the bike, the biggest source of drag is me. Changing your position on the bike can make a big difference.

![Aerodynamic study of different riding positions](/images/aero-positions.png)

While I will try to stay as aero as possible, a comfortable position is more important and I don't want to change too much.

I wore a tight fitting jersey. Not because it looks cool but because its practicool and faster to have skin fitting clothes on then things flapping around.

Wearing a helmet actually reduces drag and makes you faster, as proven by Greg LeMond in the 1989 Tour de France[^aero-helmet]. People actually compare helmets to see which one is fastest[^helmet-test].

So wearing a helmet is a good idea. I wear a Oakley Ar05 Race helmet which does a good job. I also use glasses with a big lens to protect my eyes from the sun, wind and bugs. The frame of the glasses matches up with the helmet and reduces drag even further. Marginal gains but hey, I will take every saving I can!

I avoided wearing a backpack, thankfully a fellow SOTM attendee offered to take my laptop with him in the bus.

The rest of my stuff was stashed in my top tube bag + frame bag + so called "Arse Rocket" saddle bag. The bags are positioned to avoid increasing the frontal area and avoid any extra turbulence. In fact the bags might even help me stay aero according to some sources[^aero-bike-bags].

![My bike](/images/aero-trustini.png)

It was my first time using aerobars and it was a game changer. My intention was to give me some different positions to rest my hands. But ohh boy, when I was in the areobar position, I realized they also make you significantly more streamlined and faster peircing though the air. It was also super comfortable to be able to switch between the different positions. I will definitely be using them again on long rides.

Plus I could mount my phone on the aero bars in a chiller position. Optimal for navigation and changing up tunes on the go.

![Phone + aero bar set up](/images/phone-mount.png)

### Rolling resistance

There is another contact point. The tires. The tires are the only thing touching the ground and are the biggest source of rolling resistance.

Traditionally, the least rolling resistance (aka fastest) tire is slick and narrow, inflated to high pressure.

This idea is changing became of new perspectives, lower pressures and the industry producing tubeless tires and wider rims. According to new trends a wider tire at a lower pressure can be faster then a narrow tire at a high pressure, especially on rougher surfaces.

I like Continental GP5000 tires, and according to the rolling resistance data[^rolling-resistance] the 32mm version which I am using is not much worse then the skinny 25mm version, and is one of the faster tyres available.

![Grand Prix 5000 Different Width Rolling Resistance Test](/images/width_rolling_resistance.png)

Using 32 mm, fatter and softer tires also means more comfort, especially on the rough stuff, which is important for long rides.

With all this set up on my bike, I would be rolling with ease. The only thing left to do was to pack my bags and hit the road.

## The Wind

Nature plays a huge factor in cycling, but it's beyond your control. Sometimes you get unlucky and have a rainy headwind all day, sometimes you get blown off your bike by a gust of wind, but that is all part of the fun.

I used [windy.com](https://www.windy.com) to check the wind forecast and it looked like the wind gods would be blowing in my favour for once!

![Windy forecast](/videos/windy.gif)

Get in! I would have a tailwind all the way to Łódź.

It was also to be dry and hot, which means a lower air density and even less drag. I got lucky.
![Temperature Forecast](/images/heat.png)

## The route

I used [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com) to plan the route. I put in my start and end location and set Poznan as a waypoint to break up the journey. I tweaked the route by adding a waypoint in a national park to avoid the main road and that was it.

![Komoot route planner](/images/komoot-route-planner.png)

Komoot returns the surface type and elevation expected along the route to give you a good idea of what to expect and allowling you to pace yourself.

Komoot Premium has a feature that shows the expected weather along the route, at the time you are expected to be there. It also shows the sunrise and sunset times. Super useful for deciding what to take out with you on a tour.

I saved [the route](https://www.komoot.com/tour/1700459745) offline on my phone, strapped it to my handlebars, and navigated my way.

## The Journey

TODO: talk about dropping a laptop off at Domoniks and then leaving berlin, the first 100km to the border, the border crossing, the first night in poland, the second day and the arrival in Łódź.

TODO: talk about going over the oder river and noticing the difference in surface quality

TODO: talk about how clean poland is and there was no trash anywhere

TODO: Talk about the polish gravel gang you met after not seeing anyone on a bike for 400km and how they raced into town and got some burgers.

![The Polish Gravel Gang](/images/unicorn.jpeg)

## The Food

A few people asked me how I would eat on the road. In Poland you find "Sklep Polski" everywhere. Which are small local shops selling everything you need. The owners were always nice and refilled my water bottles. I also wanted to taste some traditional polish food, so I stopped at a couple of restaurants along the way and had some great Pierogi.

Since it was so hot I needed to drink a lot of water on the ride, but it was never a problem to find on route. I took some isotonic tablets with me to stay hydrated.

## Conclusion

State of the Map 2024 was fantastic! I had a great time and learnt a lot, which could fill another blog post.

The journey itself was a highlight and went incredibly well.

Traveling across Poland by bike gave me an opportunity to see the country evolve. I saw the small villages, the fields, the forests, the rivers and the big Cities. I had a lot of time to see it and take it all.

Cycling has many uncountable benefits, but for me its the best way to travel and straight up fun. I recommend for anyone interested to get out there and give it a go!
