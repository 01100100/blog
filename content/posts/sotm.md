## Intro

Next week I'll be traveling to the [State of the Map Europe](https://stateofthemap.eu) that will be held in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland. My plan is to ride my bike from Berlin.

## Set up

{{< admonition type=tip title="What is best bike?" >}}

> The best bike is the one you have, go out and ride it!

- The Budha

{{< /admonition >}}

I strongly believe that you can enjoy a bike tour on pretty much any bike.

Saying that, this ride will involve a couple big days on the bike. I have learnt a bit about longer riding, and want to ensure a comfy fit over the whole journey.

I will attach some aero bars, to give me more hand positions to change between and hopefully avoid any nerve damage[^nerve-damage-in-bikepacking]. 

I want to travel as efficient as possible. Lightweight is always a bonus, but on this flat ride I am more concerned with getting lower rolling resistance and staying aero.

I also want to avoid wearing a backpack, and instead load my bike evenly with the rest of my gear.

Therefore my priority is to use a good tire setup and keep my luggage out the way of turbulent air.

The riding plan is to take it easy and build some endurance from long hours on the bike without pushing it and burning myself out, in a way to prepare for some bigger events coming up.

TODO: Add a picture of all the stuff.

## The Side Quest

So I am going to a mapping convention and want to make the journey part of the adventure and combine two of my passions along the way. Cycling and open data.

On idea I had was that I could add tag information to OpenStreetMap

I am aware of a nice Android app called [Steet Complete]() that assigns you quests to do in a radius near you.

TODO: add a video of street complete.


Think of Pokemon Go but instead of going out and catching a virtual Pikachu, you measure a tree or something weird. I say this is weird because I don't really have any use for the data of how fat a random tree is in Poland, but thats the beauty of Open data. Someone else might find it useful, one mans trash is another mans treasure. And more so, the power comes from the size of the community contributing data. This data point combined with the millions of other enities on OSM that allow a virtual planet to be modelled. Thats powerful stuff.

## The Perfect Wand for the Wizard

> The wand chooses the wizard
- Garrick Ollivander

I was thinking of the perfect app for my ride, I would like a app that knows when I am on a road which has incomplete data about the surface type (or riding past another quest that is drive-by possible). The app should alert me when I am riding up to a new tagging opertunities and show clearly the location of the quest object in question so I can find it. It should then presents me with a clear question and easy to press options on a screen such that I can pull a hit-and-run.

## Improving on Street Complete for the Shred community 

## Designing the route

For the route, I would like to maximise the number of "virgin" roads that I tag to maximize my contributions/km. But honest this is already a big enough project and that can be a idea for next time.

I will probably just use komoot to plan it in a couple minuets pre kick off.

## The Wind

Lets see if I get lucky and have a tailwind pushing me all the way to Lodz or a fat head wind.



Mehh its out of my control anyway. will ride either way.

## The goal

Some quick pencil maths says I will probably be moving for 500km / 25km/h = 20 hours.

If I do a quest on a average of every 10 mins, that will be 120 quests. I think that is more then possible.

More then anything I want to have a good time and arrive safely to SOTM.

[^500km]: 500km exactly according to [https://www.komoot.com/tour/1700459745](https://www.komoot.com/tour/1700459745)
