## Intro

I went to the [State of the Map Europe](https://stateofthemap.eu) event! A annual gathering of OpenSteetMap entuasthists were people talk in code and sentences like "" are often spoken. I am newish to the OSM world and saw it as a great opertunity to get involved and learn more about the community and the projects that are happening in the space. Oh my, What a big space it turns out to be! OSM is everywhere.

Some special talks, for no specific reasons:

* [AI-assisted mapping by the Humanitarian OSM Team (HOT🔥)](https://cfp.openstreetmap.org.pl/state-of-the-map-europe-2024/talk/PQ8VKC/)
* [Flowing Connections: Mapping rivers & streams with WaterwayMap.org](https://cfp.openstreetmap.org.pl/state-of-the-map-europe-2024/talk/K8LF7U/)
* [Supporting Mobility Transitions: OpenStreetMap's Contribution to Public Administration Data Need](https://cfp.openstreetmap.org.pl/state-of-the-map-europe-2024/talk/V8ZB3U/)
* [Minutely vector tiles for the community](https://cfp.openstreetmap.org.pl/state-of-the-map-europe-2024/talk/M8HTSJ/)

(I heard the streetcomplete and maplibre talks were also great, but I wanted to go to another talk at the same time)

The organizing team did a great job. I met a lot of cool people whilst learning about some new interesting project, and completely had my thirst of knowledge quenched. Whilst being shown a beautiful Polish city.

A lot of people I met were interested in my journey to the event and had many questions about how I managed to transport myself to the event.

![My ride to Łódź](/videos/ride-poland-wide.gif)

This blog post is to share how I rode my bike from Berlin to SOTM held in Łódź, Poland. 500km[^500km] in 2 days.

## Set up

{{< admonition type=tip title="What is best bike?" open=false >}}

The best bike is the one you have, go out and ride it!

\--- The Budha

{{< /admonition >}}

I strongly believe that you can enjoy a bike tour on pretty much any bike.

Saying that, this ride involved a couple big days on the bike. I wanted to go fast and efficant and have a comfy fit over the whole journey and not be too tired when I arrive. The route was mostly flat and I mostly rode on the road to save time.

I tried to optimize my setup to make the ride as comfortable and fast as possible.

My priorities:

* Comfort
* Aero
* Rolling resistance

As there were no real climbs, I didn't need to worry about weight too much. I could have taken a heavier bike and more gear and it wouldn't have made much overall difference to my speed.

## Comfort

Trustini is my go to long distance stead. I have done a many long rides on it and know it fits me well. She is a gravel bike, relaxed geometry, buttery smooth titanium with a lot of history.

TODO: insert mix up picture of trustini

It is important to think about the contact points. The saddle, handlebars and pedals. These are where you can accumulate discomfort on the longer rides, which undealt with, can lead to damage. Everyone body is different and it is best to experiment with different setups to find out what works for you personally.

I use a narrow [Brooks C13 Cambium](https://www.brooksengland.com/en_eu/c13.html) saddle which has a bit of flex. I find it very comfortable for long rides. And team it up with a my most comfortable bib shorts from Santini that include a butt saving "C3 seatpad with anti-shock gel inserts".

For the handlebars, I use the thickest bar tape I can find. The idea is more cushion absorbs the vibrations that come through the bars better. I also wear padded gloves.

![Different width bar tapes are available.](/images/bartape.png)

My friend Micheal gave me some aero bars to try out, this gives me more hand positions to change between and hopefully avoid any nerve damage[^nerve-damage-in-bikepacking] from the long days in the saddle.

## Aerodynamics

When cycling above 15km/h, the biggest thing that is slowing you down is the air resistance or drag.

Considering I am much bigger then the bike, the biggest source of drag is me. I will try to stay as aero as possible. I will wear a tight fitting jersey and bib shorts. They don't look cool but they are practicool. Flapping in the wind is not fast.  

Wearing a helmet actually reduces drag and makes you faster, as proven by Greg LeMond in the 1989 Tour de France[^aero-helmet]. People compare helmets to see which one is fastest[^helmet-test]. So wearing a helmet is a good idea. I wear a Oakley Ar05 Race helmet which does a good job. I also use glasses with a big lens to protect my eyes from the sun, wind and bugs. The frame of the glasses matches up with the helmet and reduces drag even further. Probably minimal but hey, I will take every saving I can!

I avoided wearing a backpack, thankfully a fellow SOTM attendee offered to take my laptop with him in the bus.

The rest of my stuff was stashed in my top tube bag + frame bag + so called "Arse Rocket" saddle bag. The bags are positioned to avoid increasing the frontal area and avoid any extra turbulence. In fact the bags might even help me stay aero according to some sources[^aero-bike-bags].

![My bike](/images/bike.jpg)

It was my first time using aerobars and it was a game changer. My intention was to give me some different positions to rest my hands. But ohh boy, when I was in the areobar position, I realized they also make you significantly more streamlined and faster peircing though the air. It was also super comfortable to be able to switch between the different positions. I will definitely be using them again on long rides.

## Rolling resistance

The least rolling resistance (aka fastest) tire is typically a slick and narrow tire inflated to a high pressure.

This idea is changing became of new perspectives, lower pressures and the industry producing tubeless tires and wider rims. According to new trends a wider tire at a lower pressure can be faster then a narrow tire at a high pressure, especially on rougher surfaces.

I like Continental GP5000 tires, and according to the rolling resistance data[^rolling-resistance] the 32mm version which I am using is not much worse then the 25mm version and one of the faster tyres out there.

![Chart of different width Conti GP5000 rolling resistance](/images/width_rolling_resistance.png)

Fatter and softer tires also means more comfort, especially on the rough stuff, which is important for long rides.

I am using tubes but interested to try a tubeless setup out in the future, reported to have even lower rolling resistance according to the same site [bicyclerollingresistance.com](https://www.bicyclerollingresistance.com/specials/grand-prix-5000-s-tr-tubeless-vs-tubes). One thing I appreciate about tubes is that they are so easy to fix on the road.

## The Wind

Nature plays a huge factor in cycling. But its something out of your control and I would ride anyway. Sometimes you get unlucky and have a rainy headwind all day, sometimes you get blown off your bike by a gust of wind, but that can be considered fun.

I used [windy.com](https://www.windy.com) to check the wind forecast and it looked like the wind gods would be blowing in my favour for once!

![Windy forecast](/images/windy-forecast.gif)

Get in! I should have a tailwind to ride all the way to Łódź.

It was also going to be hot, which means a lower air density and even less drag. I got lucky with the weather.

## The route

I used [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com) to plan the route. It is a great tool for planning bike routes. It takes into account the surface type, elevation and traffic to give you a good idea of what to expect. I put in my start and end location and set Poznan as a waypoint to break up the journey. I adjusted the route by dragging the line though a national park to avoid the main road and that was it. I had a route.

I saved the route for offline usage on my phone, strapped the phone to the handel bars and used it to navigate.

## The Journey

TODO: talk about dropping a laptop off at Domoniks and then leaving berlin, the first 100km to the border, the border crossing, the first night in poland, the second day and the arrival in Łódź.

TODO: Talk about the polish gravel gang you met after not seeing anyone on a bike for 400km and how they raced into town and got some burgers.

## The analysis

Road surface types
km of different types of roads

## The End

## The geo side quest

TODO: talk about road surface completness on the way, and the different surface types.

Say that you learnt about mapilary

TODO: add how it would be possible to use technology to make the process of collecting this data more efficient.

## Conclusion

Talk about learning about different projects in the conference and how the journey was a great way to get to know the country and the people.

Talk about the resources out there to

## The future

Streetcomplete for bikers

## The Side Quest

So I am going to a mapping convention and want to make the journey part of the adventure and combine two of my passions along the way. Cycling and open data.

On idea I had was that I could add tag information to OpenStreetMap

If your intereseted in helping complete OpenStreetMap data, there are a couple easy ways to do so.

I am aware of a nice Android app called [Steet Complete](https://streetcomplete.app) that assigns you quests to do in a radius near you.

TODO: add a video of street complete.

Think of Pokemon Go but instead of going out and catching a virtual Pikachu, you measure a tree or something weird. I say this is weird because I don't really have any use for the data of how fat a random tree is in Poland, but thats the beauty of Open data. Someone else might find it useful, one mans trash is another mans treasure. And more so, the power comes from the size of the community contributing data. This data point combined with the millions of other enities on OSM that allow a virtual planet to be modelled. Thats powerful stuff.

## The Perfect Wand for the Wizard

> The wand chooses the wizard

* Garrick Ollivander

I was thinking of the perfect app for my ride, I would like a app that knows when I am on a road which has incomplete data about the surface type (or riding past another quest that is drive-by possible). The app should alert me when I am riding up to a new tagging opertunities and show clearly the location of the quest object in question so I can find it. It should then presents me with a clear question and easy to press options on a screen such that I can pull a hit-and-run.

The perfect phone would be something like a unihertz atom, a small rugged phone that can be mounted on the stem and has a long battery life. It would be cool to 3d print a custom mount for it.

## Improving on Street Complete for the Shred community

## Designing the route

For the route, I would like to maximise the number of "virgin" roads that I tag to maximize my contributions/km. But honest this is already a big enough project and that can be a idea for next time.

I will probably just use komoot to plan it in a couple minuets pre kick off.

## The goal

Some quick pencil maths says I will probably be moving for 500km / 25km/h = 20 hours.

More then anything I want to have a good time and arrive safely to SOTM.
