Streetcomplete for bikers

## The Side Quest

So I am going to a mapping convention and want to make the journey part of the adventure and combine two of my passions along the way. Cycling and open data.

On idea I had was that I could add tag information to OpenStreetMap

If your intereseted in helping complete OpenStreetMap data, there are a couple easy ways to do so.

I am aware of a nice Android app called [Steet Complete](https://streetcomplete.app) that assigns you quests to do in a radius near you.

TODO: add a video of street complete.

Think of Pokemon Go but instead of going out and catching a virtual Pikachu, you measure a tree or something weird. I say this is weird because I don't really have any use for the data of how fat a random tree is in Poland, but thats the beauty of Open data. Someone else might find it useful, one mans trash is another mans treasure. And more so, the power comes from the size of the community contributing data. This data point combined with the millions of other enities on OSM that allow a virtual planet to be modelled. Thats powerful stuff.

## The Perfect Wand for the Wizard

* Garrick Ollivander

I was thinking of the perfect app for my ride, I would like a app that knows when I am on a road which has incomplete data about the surface type (or riding past another quest that is drive-by possible). The app should alert me when I am riding up to a new tagging opertunities and show clearly the location of the quest object in question so I can find it. It should then presents me with a clear question and easy to press options on a screen such that I can pull a hit-and-run.

The perfect phone would be something like a unihertz atom, a small rugged phone that can be mounted on the stem and has a long battery life. It would be cool to 3d print a custom mount for it.

## Improving on Street Complete for the Shred community

## Designing the route

For the route, I would like to maximise the number of "virgin" roads that I tag to maximize my contributions/km. But honest this is already a big enough project and that can be a idea for next time.

I will probably just use komoot to plan it in a couple minuets pre kick off.

## The goal

Some quick pencil maths says I will probably be moving for 500km / 25km/h = 20 hours.

More then anything I want to have a good time and arrive safely to SOTM.

## The analysis

Road surface types
km of different types of roads

## The possible geo side quests

TODO: talk about road surface completness on the way, and the different surface types.

Say that you learnt about mapilary

TODO: add how it would be possible to use technology to make the process of collecting this data more efficient.
